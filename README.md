# leaflet-challenge

This Challenge takes data from the USGS website to visualize all the earthquakes across the world from the past 7 days using Leaflet.
The visualization showcases numerous markers that each represent an earthquake. The size and colour of each marker correspond to the earthquake magnitude and depth respectively.
There is a legend that will provide context for your map data as well as popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

This is a link to the Website.
